  <h1>Ode to Jake's Bum</h1>
  <p>A dimple small, a curve so slight,
Jake's tiny bum, a charming sight.
No grand expanse, no sweeping round,
Just neat perfection can be found.

Like sculpted stone, a subtle grace,
A gentle slope in its small space.
A pocket-sized posterior,
That banishes all gloom and fear.

Though miniature, it holds its charm,
A cozy haven, safe from harm.
A testament that beauty lies,
In subtle curves before our eyes.

So let us praise this petite form,
That weathers every social storm.
Jake's perfect, tiny man bum, you see,
A small wonder for all to agree.</p>
